## What makes a great data engineer
- communication skills (being able to talk with clients)
- pleasant to work with (collaborate with engineer, product, business)
- technical (product focused)
- understands the big picture (especially regarding product)

## Ideal backgrounds for each three main roles:

Data Engineering:
- understands and can run basic machine learning techniques

Data Science:
- could be hired as a junior software engineer

Product Management:
- good technical background

## 


## Language priority (especially regarding data engineering)
In order of importance/relevance:

- java
- python
- scala
- ruby (on rails)

## Sensitivity analysis for projects
It is very good to do sensitivity analysis on performance with different scaling
after finishing the project, it shows one can think about scaling in relation to

## General advice
- If you need to use data science techniques (ie NPL) for your engineering project,
  you should go for the shitty ones to save time - you can always come back and use
  better ones if there is extra time.

- In your project, a focus on the actual product and service is better than trying
  to gain insights. This addresses the fact that big data technologies (infrastructure
  and people) are quite expensive and the best way to justify such spending is through
  creating new product/service rather than just simple insights.
