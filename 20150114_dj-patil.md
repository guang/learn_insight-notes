Chat with DJ Patil (relateIQ)

## Optimal First Job
- try to get a really good team
- work really hard for the first 2 years (try to get a 5 years experience out of it) (ie long
  hours)
- optimize for learning rather monies - you are not gonna make that much money on first
  job anyway
- find the position/role/job you would want many years down the road. Look at people who
  are currently in those roles and their experiences to see what work/job/experience to get
  in order to get there.


## New Guy In The Office
- talk to all kinds of people in the first few days "Hey I'm the new guy wanna get coffee yo"
- travel with coworkers, get to know them and be frands


## Office Politics
- when in conflict, state observation/facts rather than making judgements. Follow up with
  the impact of such observation on yoself in order to get people to change their behavior.


## Interview
- ask about culture: what they like/dislike
- ask about how fast things develop/iterate. go with companies that iterate fast so you
  can see the impact of your work and learn from your mistakes
